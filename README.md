## ‚û§ ‚û§ üí° Project Idea Inspiration
> As avid readers and lifelong learners, we were constantly on the lookout for new and exciting books to add to our reading lists. However, we found it challenging to discover new titles beyond the bestseller lists and popular recommendations. That's when we had the idea to create a community where readers could share their favorite books and discover new ones through personalized recommendations.

## ‚û§ üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack ReBook uses:

- This project uses the [Flask web app development framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/). Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.

- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [SQLAlchemy](https://hivedb.dev/), an open-source SQL toolkit and object-relational mapper for the Python programming language.

- The [ReBook Homepage](https://bisry.me/ReBook/)  is made by [React](https://react.org) and [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org), a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL.

- The website uses the font ["Ailerons"](https://befonts.com/ailerons-typeface.html) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to design guidelines.
